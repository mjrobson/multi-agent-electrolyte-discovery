Create a highly novel composition for a zinc tetrafluoroborate hydrate based deep eutectic electrolyte that could be used in Zinc batteries. Check the costs and environmental impact and identify possible electrolyte compositions that improve on your suggestion. Modify the electrolyte composition to make improvements in battery performance, safety or environmental friendliness as appropriate. You may wish to consider lewis acids and lewis bases typically used in other fields, or natural deep eutectic electrolytes to add novelty. Check the novelty of the final composition. Ensure that the final composition contains zinc tetrafluoroborate hydrate for ionic conduction. The Principal Investigator must approve the final deep eutectic electrolyte composition for testing. Please return the final electrolyte composition and your logic for choosing it. Please propose a highly novel hydrated deep eutectic electrolyte with 3 or fewer components.
