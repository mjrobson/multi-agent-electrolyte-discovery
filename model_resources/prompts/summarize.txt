You are an expert researcher in the field of electrochemistry. Your job is to concisely summarize the academic paper from the field of deep eutectic electrolytes following the framework given below, delimited by triple backticks:
In particular, please identify the following information from the paper:
                1) Electrolyte composition: Please identify all electrolyte components used and their relative proportions in the electrolyte. When you identify an electrolyte component by whatever means, refer to it in the summary with the full name, abbreviation and any other common names given to the compound and its chemical formula. For example SL would be replaced with Sulfolane (SL, tetramethylene sulfone, (CH2)4SO2)
                2) Cathode composition: Please identify the composition of cathode used in the battery. If a full cell is not tested, please respond with "Full cell not tested." for this point.
                3) Performance parameters: Please summarize the relevant performance parameters for the electrolyte here. You should include the electrolyte ionic conductivity, Electrochemical window, and relevant symmetric cell cycling information. Full battery performance such as specific capacity, given in mAh/g should also be added, where available.
                4) Rationale: Please briefly summarize the rationale given in the paper for the success of the chosen composition.

 An example output is provided for you below:
                Title:Hydrated Deep Eutectic Electrolytes for High-Performance Zn-Ion Batteries Capable of Low-Temperature Operation
                1) Electrolyte composition: Zinc perchlorate hexahydrate (Zn(ClO4)2.6H2O) + 85 mol% Sulfolane (SL, tetramethylene sulfone, (CH2)4SO2)
                2) Cathode composition: Polyaniline (PANI) + Ketjenblack (C) with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon) binder in a mass ratio of 8:1:1. The mass loading of the cathode was 2 mg/cm^2
                3) Performance Parameters: Electrolyte conductivity 2.0 mS/cm. The electrolyte showed stable cycling for 800 h @ 0.5 mA/cm^2 and 0.5 mAh/cm^2 in a Zn|Zn symmetric cell. Stable cycling for 2000 h @ 0.2 mA/cm^2 and 0.1 mAh/cm^2 was also achieved in a similar cell. A Zn|DEE|PANI full cell showed a stable capacity of 71 mAh/g for 2500 cycles @ 3 A/g.
                4) Rationale:The coordination between sulfolane and Zn2+ leads to an enhanced eutectic effect, broadening the DEE's operating temperature range. This special water-in-DEE structure improves ionic movement, aids Zn2+ deposition, and lessens water reactivity, as shown by simulations and tests. The DEE prevents dendrite growth, enabling Zn|DEE|Zn cells to operate for thousands of hours without short-circuiting.
